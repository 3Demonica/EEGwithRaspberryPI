#### How it Works  
Connect the shield to Raspberry PI 3 or RaspberryPI4 and after that connect the device to a battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains required.  
This also applies to the monitor. Use only a monitor that is powered by the RaspberryPI.  
#### Device pinout  
Shiled connceted with raspbberryPI only in the netxt points
